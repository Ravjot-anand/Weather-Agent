*****AI Weather Assistant*****

An AI-powered weather chat application built using React + Vite + Tailwind CSS on the frontend and FastAPI + LangChain + OpenRouter on the backend.
The assistant understands natural language queries and dynamically uses a weather tool (Open-Meteo, no API key) to provide real-time weather insights.

*****Features*****

💬 Chat-based UI (modern, responsive design)

🤖 LLM-powered assistant using OpenRouter

🛠️ Tool calling with LangChain

🌍 Real-time weather data using Open-Meteo (no API key required)

⚡ FastAPI backend with REST API

🎨 Tailwind CSS for clean and modern UI

🔄 End-to-end React ↔ FastAPI integration

*****How It Works*****

User sends a natural language query via the chat UI

FastAPI receives the request

LangChain passes the query to the LLM

LLM dynamically calls the Open-Meteo weather tool

Weather data is returned and converted into a human-friendly response

Response is displayed in the chat interface
